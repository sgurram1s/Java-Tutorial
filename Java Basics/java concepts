What is Java?
    Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995.
    It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java.
    It is used for:
        Mobile applications (specially Android apps)
        Desktop applications
        Web applications
        Web servers and application servers
        Games
        Database connection
        And much, much more!


Why Use Java?
    Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
    It is easy to learn and simple to use
    It is open-source and free
    It is secure, fast and powerful
    It has a huge community support (tens of millions of developers)
    Java is an object oriented language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs
    As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa.


The extension for java file is .java
In java the file name must be same as class name.
And the java is a case sensitive.


Printing Output:
    The syntax for printing output is
        System.out.print();
    and we can also use println() for printing the output and then going to next line.
    for example,
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
        System.out.println(50000);
        System.out.println(3 + 3);

Comments in Java:
    for single line commenting we use ( // ).
    for example,
        //This is a single line comment in java
    for multiline commenting we use ( /* ) at the beginning and ( */ ) at the end.
    for example,
        /* this is for
           multi line commenting in java */.


Variables in Java:
    The syntax for declaring the variables are:
        type variable_name;
        type variable_name = value;
        type variable_name_1, variable_name_2, ....;    // for declaring multiple variables.
    for example,
        int myNum = 15;
        String name = "John";
        float myFloatNum = 5.99f;
        char myLetter = 'D';
        boolean myBool = true;
    Rules for naming variables are:
        Name can have letters, digits, underscores and also dollar sign($).
        name can begin with a letter, underscore or dollar($) sign.
        Name should start with lowercase and should not have white spaces.
        Can't use java keywords.
        Names are case sensitive.
    for example,
        myvar, myVar, _myVar, $Var etc.


Data Types in Java:
    There are two data types in java:
        Primitive Data Type
            A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.
            There are eight primitive data types in Java:
                Data Type       Size        Description
                byte            1 byte      Stores from -128 to 127
                short           2 bytes     Stores from -32768 to 32767
                int             4 bytes     Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
                long            8 bytes     Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
                float           4 bytes     Stores decimal value upto 6 to 7 decimal digits
                double          8 bytes     Stores decimal value upto 15 decimal digits.
                boolean         1 bit       Stores true or false
                char            2 bytes     Stores single character/letter/ASCII values

        Non-Primitive Data Type
